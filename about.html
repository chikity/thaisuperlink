Introduction

We came to work in Thailand from Hong Kong many years ago.
Over the years we have casually helped friends and friends
of friends do errands such as collecting rent for their
rental properties, arranging repairs and even renovation of
apartments, making payments for products and services that
they purchased, coordinating delivery of their purchases,
renewing annual license for their cars, etc.

Lastly, when they visit Thailand we bring them to local
restaurants that they can enjoy tasty food at reasonable
(non tourist) prices!

We believe we are in a position to provide tremendous help
to people who are starting to deal with Thailand for long
term prospects, or simply need something done correctly and
efficiently as a one time event, eg. wedding photos, etc..
Hence the idea of offering our service as a profession!
